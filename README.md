Programming Project 1
==================

- `make clean build`
- Execute it as `./album photos/*.jpg`, if you have a folder called photos. 
- Open the index.html file once your execution ends.
- conversions.c has the functions required for the conversions to happen. 
- fileoperations.c has the functions required to perform the file operations. 
- header.h - self explanatory. 
- album.c - It is the main program (target) that is being called by me. 
- OS Assignment.pdf has the diagram showing the lifecycle of the different child processes created by me.
